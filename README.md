Supreme Chef V.1

Thank you for downloading Supreme Chef!


-Pre-requisites-

1. Download chromdriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2. Follow the steps in this helpful YouTube video I found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8

-How to use-

1. Input your product key into the console when prompted. If your key is valid, the program will start. 
2. This program runs on Chrome and you can see everything the bot is doing in the Chrome window it opens. Make sure you have chrome installed.
3. Use a good Gmail login. The older the Gmail account you use, the faster the Captchas will be. 
4. Fill out all fields.
5. Click "save". This saves your information for the next time you log on. Make sure to click "save" before starting a task.
6. Start a task: When you click the "create task" button, it'll create an area that shows the status of the task. Be sure to close the Chrome window with the "stop task" button when you are done.
It will also create a Chrome window, which is where the bot runs. You can watch the window to see what the bot is doing at any point.


-Functionality-

1. The bot works for restocks and drops, although the restock feature is not very functional due to the fact that restocks sellout in milliseconds.
2. The bot is actually extremely fast, and beats other lower priced bots I have used to checkout.
3. You can watch what the bot does in the Chrome window for a more detailed view on how it works. It's pretty simple.


-Do I have the fields filled in correctly?-

1. For the item's sizing and the item's name, it doesn't have to be the full name or size, it can just be partial text. For example: if the item's name is "Box Logo L/S Tee" and the color
is "Heather Grey", you could put "Box Logo" for the name, and "Grey" for the size. Just make sure the phrase you put is included in the name, for example you couldn't put "Box Tee"
for the name because the words aren't together in the item name. 
2. EVERYTHING IS CASE SENSITIVE. Make sure to fill out the fields exactly as it shows up on the website. If the color is "Black" do not put "black" or it won't find the color. For the item
category, if the category is "t-shirts" DO NOT put "T-shirts".
3. Make sure you format the phone number like this: 123 456 7890
4. Format the card number like this: 1234 1234 1234 1234
5. For the month on the card, do NOT put a "0" before the month. For ex. do not put "09" if it expires in September, just put a "9".
5. For the card year, put the full year. For ex. don't put "22" if it expires 2022. Put "2022".


-Other info-

1. PayPal checkout is basically useless. You will have to manually login to PayPal when prompted.
2. If the item doesn't have sizing, make sure you don't check the "size options" box. 
3. Don't go too crazy on the tasks or it'll slow down your pc/wifi. You also risk being banned by Supreme if you run too many tasks.
4. Your information is stored in the "info.dat" file. Don't share this file.
5. Once your software is activated, the key will be stored in "key.dat" so that you don't need to put the key in every time. Don't share this file either.

Enjoy!
